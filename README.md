# Google Earth Engine Javascript Examples
This is a collection of examples how to code with Google Earth Engine Javascript API. If you are already signed up in Google Earth Engine, just copy and paste my code in the [Google Earth Engine Sandbox](https://code.earthengine.google.com).

#### 001 Landsat 8 Classification plus spectra chart
Classification Example for Landsat 8 plus spectra for classes in classified region.
<br><br>
#### 002 Landsat 8 TOA Tasseled Cap Transformation:
Tasseled Cap Transformation for Landsat 8 based on the scientfic work "Derivation of a tasselled cap transformation based on Landsat 8 at-satellite reflectance" by M.Baigab, L.Zhang, T.Shuai & Q.Tong (2014). The bands of the output image are the brightness index, greenness index and wetness index.
<br><br>
#### 003 RapidEye Spectral Angle Mapper:
Spectral Angle map calculation for RapidEye imagery. Please note, you might not be able to see the RapidEye imagery because they belong to a private repository. You can still use the Spectral Angle Mapper for Landsat as well.
<br><br>
#### 004 Forest loss calculation:
Calculation of overall forest loss between 2010 and 2015 for the consecutive years.
<br><br>
#### 005 Loss calculation for MODIS Landcover Classification's 'Mixed Forest' class:
Calculation of loss in class 'Mixed Forest' based on the MODIS Land cover classification 2012 between 2012 and 2015 for the consecutive years.
<br><br>
#### 006 High potential forest map compared to MODIS Landcover Classification's forest classes:
High forest potential map for the Mexican state of Chiapas according to [The Nature Conservancy](http://www.nature.org) and [Alianza México REDD+](http://www.alianza-mredd.org/) compared with MODIS Land cover classification 2012's forest classes.
<br><br>
#### 007 RapidEye Tasseled Cap Transformation:
Tasseled Cap Transformation for RapidEye Imagery based on the scientfic work [Derivation of Tasseled Cap Coefficients for RapidEye data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270302804_Derivation_of_Tasseled_Cap_Coefficients_for_RapidEye_data) by M.Schoenert, H.Weichelt, E.Zillmann & C.Jürgens (2014). The bands of the output image are the brightness index, greenness index and yellowness index. Note: You might not be able to see the RapidEye scene because of license issues but feel free to use my code on your RapidEye scene(s).
<br><br>
#### 008 WEKA Learning Vector Quantization Clustering:
Example which demonstrates clustering that implements WEKA Learning Vector Quantization algorithm for Landsat 8 based on T. Kohonen, "Learning Vector Quantization", The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, 2003, pp. 631-634.
<br><br>
#### 009 Spectra analysis on Landsat 8 TOA & Proba-V S1 TOC
Example of spectra analysis on Landsat 8 TOA & Proba-V S1 TOC on features such as agriculture, urban and water.
<br><br>
#### 010 MODIS regional or zonal statistics calculation
Regional or zonal statistics calculation based on a MODIS Net Primary Productivity ([MOD17A3](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod17a3)) for  MODIS Land Cover Type ([MCD12Q1](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mcd12q1)) class 'Mixed forest'. Net Primary Productivity defines the rate at which all plants in an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy.<br><br><br><br>
